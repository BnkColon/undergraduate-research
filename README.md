 I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus. I'm doing a research on Techniques for Anomaly Detection in IPv4 &amp; IPv6 Network Flows with Dr. Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga since September 2014.
 
 Here you can find a description of my research per semester and the description/results [step-by-step](https://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/bianca.html) from last semester. 

I presented posters about my research in Women in CyberSecurity Conference (WiCyS) on March 2015, in Atlanta, GA. Also in the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions Conference (CAHSI) on September 2015 and in Women in CyberSecurity Conference (WiCyS) on March 2016, Dallas, TX. Also participate in Malcon CTF 2015 with three partners and win first place.

My career short term goals are to finish my degree in Computer Science and still doing undergraduate research. Furthermore, my long-term goals are to pursue graduate studies in computer science.

My work is supported by the scholarship Academics and Training for the Advancement of Cybersecurity Knowledge in Puerto Rico [(ATACK-PR)](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~atackpr/) supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DUE-1438838.
