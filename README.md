 I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus. I'm doing a research on Techniques for Anomaly Detection in IPv4 &amp; IPv6 Network Flows with Dr. Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga since September 2014.
 
 Here you can find a description of my research per semester and the description/results [step-by-step](https://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/bianca.html) from last semester that includes the implementation of the Benford's Law in Network Flows. 

I presented posters about my research in Women in CyberSecurity Conference (WiCyS) on March 2015, in Atlanta, GA. Also in the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions Conference (CAHSI) on September 2015 and in Women in CyberSecurity Conference (WiCyS) on March 2016, Dallas, TX. Also, participated in Malcon Capture the Flag (CTF) 2015 teamed with a group of 3 and won first place.

My career short term goals are to finish my degree in Computer Science. Furthermore, my long-term goals are to pursue a master's degree in the security field.

My work is supported by the scholarship Academics and Training for the Advancement of Cybersecurity Knowledge in Puerto Rico [(ATACK-PR)](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~atackpr/) supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DUE-1438838.
